        <p>Just mix a handful of simple ingredients, drop the dough onto a
            baking sheet, and brush it with a little butter. In about twenty
            minutes total, you’ll have warm, golden brown biscuits that are
            perfect for serving with:

            Homemade jam (We love strawberry, blackberry and peach)
            Sausage gravy
            Soups, stews and chili
            They also make a great foundation for savory breakfast sandwiches
            with eggs or sausage – or both! I hope you love them as much as we
            do. If you try them out please come back and rate the recipe.
            Unfortunately, almond flour absorbs liquid differently than most
            gluten-free flour blends and won’t likely work in this recipe.

            I’m egg free. Can I use an egg replacer such as a flax egg in this
            recipe?

            I haven’t tested it with any egg replacements, but if you do please
            leave a comment and let us know how it turns out.
